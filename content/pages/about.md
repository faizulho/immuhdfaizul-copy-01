**Muhammad Faizul** aka Muhd Faizul (in short) is the Administrator for #ImMuhdFaizul and its subsidiary assets in the cybersphere. Faizul is born in Singapore and spent his entire life there, including his education, youth and working life. Just like any other ordinary guy trying to make ends meet in Singapore, the reality of being in a minority community and jobless is slowly taking a toll on his optimism and enthusiasm with life. 

Regardless of how Fate can deal with him, Faizul leaves his fate to the Almighty and fights every challenge that comes his way. Faizul is also looking to make more friends from the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore and the region. If you are genuine and keen, please contact Faizul. Ladies and gentlemen of all age groups of the Malay-Muslim community are included.

Muhammad Faizul's favourite quote
